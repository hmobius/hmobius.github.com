  <h1>Technical Writing</h1>
  <section>
    <p>I am often writing or editing technical documentation for both open source and paid-for projects. On this page, you'll find a small selection of writing from projects I have been allowed to reproduce.</p>
    <h2>Gallio \ MbUnit</h2>
    <p>
      MbUnit was a unit-testing framework for .NET circa 2004 - 2012. In 2007, a full rewrite of the test suite and an automation framework that would run it andany other unit testing framework called Gallio began. Here you'll find the <a href="gallio/Gallio.chm">complete API documentation as a Compiled Help file</a> and a nascent PDF version of a <a href="gallio/GallioBook.pdf">Gallio book</a> covering unit testing with MbUnit and Gallio in detail. You can find the Gallio repos on <a href="https://github.com/Gallio">github</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Simple.Data</h2>
    <p>
      Simple.Data was a lightweight framework that used the dynamic features of .NET 4 to provide an expressive, ORM-ish way of accessing and manipulating data without any of the code pre-generation and boilerplate required by other frameworks. Here you'll find the <a href="simpledata/index.html">full documentation</a> for the project as it stood before it's creator moved on to other projects and the documentation effort ended.
